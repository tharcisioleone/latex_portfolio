# Welcome to my Latex Portfolio
You will find here some examples of my work in Latex. The files refer to the studies "Does a productivity bonus pay off?" and "The geography of intergenerational mobility". For both studies, I created the main manuscript and online data appendix.
Please visit my private homepage to see the published version of the studies.
