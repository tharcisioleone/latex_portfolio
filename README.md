# Welcome to my Latex Portfolio !
You will find here some examples of my work in Latex. The files refer to the studies "Does a productivity bonus pay off?" and "Geography of mobility". 
For my studies, I have ever created in Latex the main manuscript, online appendix, and slides for the presentation of the findings. To see the final version of the files in PDF, please visit my private homepage: [Tharcisio Leone](https://tharcisio-leone.com/publication/).

If you're using my code, you are welcome to connect with me on LinkedIn and optionally send me feedback to help steer this or other code I have already published: [Tharcisio Leone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tharcisio-leone/).
